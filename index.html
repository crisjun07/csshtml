                        <p>
                            My name is Crisjun Labadan, and I am a 19-year-old first-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology
                             (BSIT). As a newcomer to college life, I am excited about the opportunities to learn and grow in the field of technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>      My courses so far have been both challenging and rewarding, and I look forward to developing my skills in programming, networking, and system management over the coming years.
                             Outside of academics, I have a strong passion for playing online games. Gaming has been a hobby of mine for several years,
                              offering both entertainment and a way to connect with friends and other players from around the world. 
                              I enjoy the competitive aspect of games, as well as the teamwork and strategy required to succeed.
                              Whether itâ€™s solo play or team-based challenges, gaming provides me with a sense of relaxation and excitement.
                               Balancing my studies and hobbies is important to me, and I aim to excel in both areas.
                        </p>
